# PROJECT OVERVIEW
This is a Flutter Super App (Ride & Food) using Supabase.
Architecture: Modular Monolith.

# FOLDER STRUCTURE (STRICT)
1. lib/common/
   - SHARED resources only.
   - Contains: AuthService, SupabaseService, BookingService, shared Models, and shared Widgets.
   - RULE: Always check this folder first. If a service/widget exists here, IMPORT it. Do not recreate it.

2. lib/apps/customer/
   - Code specific to the Customer Role (Ride hailing, Food ordering).

3. lib/apps/driver/
   - Code specific to the Driver Role (Job feed, Navigation).

4. lib/apps/merchant/
   - Code specific to the Merchant Role (Menu management, Incoming orders).

# CODING RULES
- Do not cross-import logic between apps (e.g., Driver app should not import Customer screens).
- Use `Supabase.instance.client` from `lib/common/services/supabase_service.dart`.
- When fixing bugs, read the existing file context first.
